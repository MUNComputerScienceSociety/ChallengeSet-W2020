# Week 6 (Feb 17th)

Welcome to the sixth week of _ChallengeSet_!

It's the midterm break, so we've only got a single challange this week.

_But_, you also have a chance to win a GitHub t-shirt voucher! (Thanks to [@ZapMe](https://github.com/zapme))

[Sudoku Solution Checker](../problems/sudokuchecker)

Details can be found on the problem page about the vouchers.
