# Week 1 (Jan 14th)

Welcome to the first week of _ChallengeSet_, a _set_ of _challenges_ we're planning on putting out every week of this semester!

This first week is a tidy little introduction one: below you'll find a few misc. Kattis problems we've picked out for you to try:

[Above Average](https://open.kattis.com/problems/aboveaverage)

[Amsterdam Distance](https://open.kattis.com/problems/amsterdamdistance)

[A Towering Problem](https://open.kattis.com/problems/towering)

[Autori](https://open.kattis.com/problems/autori)

## How do I use Kattis?

You can use Kattis' [Python 3 Help](https://open.kattis.com/help/python3) section for information, or something like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NHyzBN4GAM).

If none of that works, feel free to reach out in the Discord for help on getting your program running!

## Testing your Solutions

Sample input and output for all problems have been given under the subdirectory `week-01/test-samples/`. The input files must be piped into your solution in order to test them.

An example command for doing this for an arbitrary python solution is `cat test-samples/<problemid>/1.in | python <username>/<problemid>.py` . 

The expected output for any given solution is found under the subdirectory `week-01/test-samples/<problemid>/<sample-number>.ans` .  

## Submitting Solutions

Submissions to problems can be submitted past **Friday @ 5:00pm (January 17th, 2020)**, please don't distribute submissions to GitHub before this date, so every one has a chance to do their own thing before this time!

Either you can:

### Use GitHub

This is the preferable method, since learning git is a very useful skill in itself!

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Place your submission within this directory (`week1/`), in a sub-directory that is your mun name, or simply GitHub username (ex. `week1/jaharrhy`, `week1/nint8836`, `week1/rod`, `week1/nidlidstone`, etc.)
3. Ensure that your submission works within said directory, along with instructions on how to run the code:

> How to run my code: ...
> 
> Here is the command I ran to run my code: `cat input.txt | python solution.py`

### Contact an Executive

If you're not comfortable with git, feel free to reach out to one of the following executives with your code, so we can submit it to this repository for you instead:

- Jack (\<i\>jack arthur null\</i\>#1337)
- Eva (eva twin#0001)
- Kent (Kent B#3019)

## What do I get out of it?

- Programming practice
- git practice, & GitHub contributions
- _Bragging rights_, since you'll be noted within the root `README.md` of this project as a contributor


- Still up in the air is _awards_, for more 'misc' categories: 'least lines', 'worst code', 'most time taken to run yet still completing', etc. (open for you guys to give input as well!)
