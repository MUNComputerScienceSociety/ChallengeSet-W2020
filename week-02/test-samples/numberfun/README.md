# ML Training Data

- `numberfun_data_n.csv` - 10,000 inputs that **do not** result in a solution.
- `numberfun_data_y.csv` - 10,000 inputs that **do** result in a solution.
- `a, b` are ranged from 1 to 20 inclusive
- `c` is ranged from 0-400 inclusive

Someone please try to train a neural net to solve this problem!
