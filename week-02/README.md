# Week 2

Welcome to the second week of _ChallengeSet_!

Keeping with the same theme as last week, we've got a mixed bag of questions, some that should be simple, and others that might taken you a bit of time to solve.

Remember, you're welcome to submit as-little-and-as-many solutions as you like, if you only have time to tackle a single question, that's fine by us!

[Seven Wonders](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sevenwonders)

[Quick Estimates](https://open.kattis.com/problems/quickestimate)

[Number Fun](https://open.kattis.com/problems/numberfun)

These ones are a little more complex, but still should be accessible to most:

This week we've also done up a custom in-house problem:
