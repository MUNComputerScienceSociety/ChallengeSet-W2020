# What exactly is this keyspam-looking garbage code?

Each of these files contains the solution to a challenge set problem written with the following rules:

* Each file must be a single statement (not a single line)
* Variable names must be comprised entirely of underscores
* No importing of any files outside the standard library (meaning you can't have multiple files for multiple statements)
* No use of string literals

# What is the difference between min files and non-min files?

Min files contain versions of the problem that in addition to being a single statement, are also a single line of text. For problems where the code is complex enough that I can't reasonably write it in a single line, I write it in a non-min file and then remove all whitespace I can from it to turn it into a min file. For some problems, the solution's code is simple enough that it can be written in a single line manually, so no non-min file is included.
